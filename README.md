# SimplyTask
Online, phone application organisation board suitable for a younger audience. Easy, Simple UI good for a wider audience and teach children how to prioritise, organise and manage their tasks from a younger age. Teachers can create tasks for their class to complete and each student can tick the tasks off as they complete them. Teachers will be able to get a good overview of their classes and see who is struggling with each task to see what content needs to be covered in more depth or which student to contact for extra help. Good way to ease children into using organisation boards like Asana or Trello so in the future, tasks such as study, team work, personal projects or work, can be organised digitally with an easier learning curve and easy task management software can be more accessible for everyone.
